# Advances in Docking Protocols for PPIs: Insights from AlphaFold2 and Molecular Dynamics Refinement

![Workflow diagram](overview.png)

## Introduction

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) modulation has seen significant advancements due to improvements in docking protocols. This study investigates the performance of AlphaFold2 (AF2) models in comparison to experimentally solved structures when used in docking protocols targeting PPIs. By evaluating a dataset of 16 interactions with validated modulators, we benchmarked eight docking protocols, finding that native and AF2 models perform similarly. Notably, local docking strategies, particularly TankBind_local and Glide, provided superior results across various structural types.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and ensemble generation algorithms like AlphaFlow were used to refine native and AF2 models, which improved docking outcomes but also revealed significant variability across different conformations. Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of docking protocols is more influenced by scoring functions than by the initial quality of protein models. While protein ensembles can enhance virtual screening, identifying the most effective conformations for docking remains a challenge. This study underscores the potential of AF2 in PPI docking and highlights the need for further refinement in scoring methodologies.

## Third-Party Tools Overview

This study utilized a variety of third-party tools, including protein scoring systems, generative models like AlphaFlow for emulating MD ensembles, and multiple docking tools. To ensure proper functionality, please install the necessary dependencies for each tool. Detailed documentation can be found on their respective pages.

### Docking Tools

Ligands and proteins were prepared using Schr√∂dinger Maestro's LigPrep and Protein Preparation protocols, respectively. The prepared ligand (SD files) and protein (PDB) files are available in `data/input_files/Protein_structures`. Key steps include:

- **Ligand Preparation:** 3D conformations were generated using the OPLS4 force field, with ligands saved as SD files. Ligands containing more than 500 atoms were excluded.
- **Protein Preparation:** Proteins underwent preprocessing and optimization, including the addition of hydrogens, disulfide bonds, and missing side chains with Prime. Het states were generated using Epik, followed by energy minimization with the OPLS4 force field.

The processed protein and ligand files were converted to PDBQT format using [Open Babel 3.1.0](https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/releases/tag/openbabel-3-1-0) as required by AutoDock Vina. Docking was conducted on individual protein chains, focusing on the protein complex interface. The grid center coordinates and simulation box sizes can be found in `data/input_files/interface_center.txt`, obtained using the script `scripts/protein_analysis/interface_center.py`.
